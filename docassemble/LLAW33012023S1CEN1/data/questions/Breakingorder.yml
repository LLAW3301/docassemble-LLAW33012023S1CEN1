question: Who do I speak to if my co-parent is breaking the parenting order?
subquestion: |
  Seek legal advice. If one parent is contravening a parenting order, the other parent may file an application to ask the Court to enforce the order.
  Consider the result you want to achieve;
  If you are seeking that the other parent receive punishment or consequence for breach of the order, complete the Application - Contravention form. (link)
  If you do not want the other parent punished, but rather want the resumption of the arrangements as set out in your order, complete the Application - Enforcement form. (link)
