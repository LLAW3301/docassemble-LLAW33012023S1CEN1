question: Where do I go if I am unhappy with the parenting order?
subquestion: |
  Speak to your lawyers. As a parenting order is a Court order, you will need to show that there has been a significant change of circumstances that makes a change necessary. 
  If you and the other party to the order do agree with any changes to be made;
  You can sign draft consent orders, which the Court can make into orders, without the need for the parties to appear in Court.
  You can enter into a parenting plan
  If you and the other party to the order do not agree
  You need to go through the same process as though you were applying for the parenting order the first time. See how to apply for parenting orders here.
