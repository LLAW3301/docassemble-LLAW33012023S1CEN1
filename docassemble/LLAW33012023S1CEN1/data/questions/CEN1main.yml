# Mandatory block which links users to FAQs.
mandatory: True
# This is the main 'if' statement that will direct the entire app
# The first branch is 'children' related questions. It will use the initial opening questions to determine if the person is eligible to continue by being either divorced or going through divorce before taking the user to the option screen of 'children', 'financial', or 'other'. If they select the children option the code will them move to the first section of the if statement below. 
 # Next is the financial branch. If the user selects they have a financial related question they will be taken here. They will first be asked some funneling questions before being presented with some relevant FAQs to their matter. This if statement determines which FAQs to present them depending on how they answer each question.
  # This is followed by the if statement for the 'other' branch. If they have a question that is not related to a child or a financial matter this is where they will be taken. Once again they will be asked a series of questions to determine if the app is able to provide answers. If not it will take the user to the 'contact centacare' screen.
