event: Safetyconcern
question: Who do I speak to if I am concerned for my child(rens) safety when they are with the other parent?
subquestion: |
  If there are Court orders in place, do not go against these orders without real grounds that any partyâ€™s (child/parent/etc.) health and/or safety is in jeopardy. Seek legal advice on your individual situation; if you breach your parenting order without real grounds, you may be punished by the court.
  If there are no Court orders in place, ensure your child is in a safe environment, and then seek legal advice regarding your situation.
