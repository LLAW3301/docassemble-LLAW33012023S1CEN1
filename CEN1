# This is the Occasion screen
event: Occ_Screen
question: Can I change our parenting plan if I need the kids for an important event/occasion? 
subquestion: | 
       Yes; the first  step, if it is safe to do so and you are comfortable, is to contact the other party/ies to your parenting plan, to see if they will agree to your suggested changes. You may also communicate through your lawyers if appropriate. As a parenting plan is not court ordered, any changes in parenting plans simply need to be agreed by parties to the plan.

# This is the Order screen
event: Order_Screen
question: Where do I go if I am unhappy with the parenting order?
subquestion: | 
         Speak to your lawyers. As a parenting order is a Court order, you will need to show that there has been a significant change of circumstances that makes a change necessary.
         
         If you and the other party to the order do agree with any changes to be made, you can sign draft consent orders, which the Court can make into orders, without the need for the parties to appear in Court.
         
           If you and the other party to the order do not agree, you need to go through the same process as though you were applying for the parenting order the first time. See how to apply for parenting orders here.

# This is the Breaking Order screen

question: Who do I speak to if my co-parent is breaking the parenting order?
subquestion: | 
  Seek legal advice. If one parent is contravening a parenting order, the other parent may file an application to ask the Court to enforce the order.
  
  Consider the result you want to achieve;
  
  If you are seeking that the other parent receive punishment or consequence for breach of the order, complete the Application - Contravention form. (link)
  
  If you do not want the other parent punished, but rather want the resumption of the arrangements as set out in your order, complete the Application - Enforcement form. (link)

# This is the Children Decision screen
event: Dec_Screen
question: Can our child(ren) have a say in where they stay?
subquestion: | 
    Children do not have a definitive say in where, or with which parent they stay with. 
    A child’s wishes is one of the many factors that the Court has to consider when determining what decisions are in the child’s best interests. The older and more mature the child is, the less likely it is that the Court will make decisions in opposition to their wishes. 
    Although there is no set-age at which a child can make their choice as to where they stay, they usually reach a point in their mid-teens where they can physically place themselves where they prefer.

question: Parenting Order
subquestion: | 
       A parenting order is a legally enforceable order issued by a court under the Family Law Act 1975. It establishes the arrangements for the care, development, and welfare of a child. It contains agreements on matters such as who the child is to live with, how much time the child will spend with each parent, how the parents will communicate on matters regarding the child, the allocation of parental responsibilities, how disputes are to be resolved, and any other matters relevant to the care, development, and welfare of a child.
